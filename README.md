A Newtonâ€™s Cradle is a classic physics demonstration that shows the principles of conservation of momentum and energy. It consists of a row of identical spheres suspended by strings so they barely touch each other.

When one ball on the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary balls, transmitting a force through the line of spheres that pushes the last ball outward. The middle balls remain almost motionless, while the energy and momentum transfer through them seamlessly.

This project is a visual and interactive simulation of the Newtonâ€™s Cradle, built using modern web technologies. It demonstrates:

âš¡ Conservation of momentum & energy

ðŸ”„ Transfer of kinetic energy through elastic collisions

ðŸŽ¨ Smooth animations for a realistic effect

Perfect for learning physics concepts or just enjoying the satisfying motion of a cradle!
